## List:
## java list interfaces --> ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Vector

### ArrayList Interface
* To store & manage ordered collections of data we go to List concept
* for the reason of dynamic resizing & efficient performance!
* sequential order
* order of insert is maintained
* can have duplicate values
* cad add null values
* by using index we can traverse list
* in ArrayList by using listIterator() we can traverse arrayList in forward and backward directions
  

### Operations used in ArrayList Interface
* add() --> add an element
