## Linked List Data Structure

###
* A Node contians 2 parts --> data and address of next node


### Difference between **LinkedList & Arrays**
### LinkedLists
* Data structure -> Non-Contigious
* Insertion & Deletio  -> Efficient
* Access --> sequential
* Memory Allocation --> Typically allocates memory one by one to individual elements

### Arrays
* Data Structure --> Contigious
* Insertion & Deletion --> Inefficient
* Access --> Random
* Memory Allocation --> Typically allocated to the whole array
